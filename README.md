# react-trivia
Trivia game I made for the Learn React course on Scrimba as the 4th solo project. Made using [Open Trivia DB](https://opentdb.com/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
At the moment I think everything is too small and hard to read (even more so on mobile). And the page looks empty. but I tried to follow the [provided design](https://www.figma.com/file/E9S5iPcm10f0RIHK8mCqKL/Quizzical-App?node-id=0%3A1).
Also the requirements of the project stated that 5 questions should be fetched so I decided not to change the number of questions fetched, even though in my opinion 10 questions would have looked better.
